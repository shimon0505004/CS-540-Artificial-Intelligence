http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs540/spr2015/more_assignments/hw315.html

This assignment includes generating a test problem collection for examination timetabling problem.

In description, the following questions are answered:
1) For the problem that you submitted, explain where you got it or how you constructed it. 
Why do you think it is a good test problem? 
Do you think it is/will be challenging? 
Why or why not? Provide any background on the type of problem if you have it.

2)Describe your algorithm and its implementation, 
explaining why you designed it as you did, 
citing any relevant literature or 
pilot experiments you did to tune your implementation.

3)Find and read a published research paper on applying an evolutionary algorithm to timetabling.
Provide the citation, summarize the paper and describe what you learned from it.
