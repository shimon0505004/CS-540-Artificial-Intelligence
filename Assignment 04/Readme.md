CS 540, Spring 2015: Assignment 4
Empirical Evaluation of Search and Evolutionary Algorithms on Timetabling.

Details of this assignment can be found on the following link:

In this assignment, we perform two experiments.
At this point, we have the following algorithms for solving exam timetabling problems:
1) A Stocastic Local search algorithm. (A2)
2) An Evolutionary Algorithm.          (A3)

In experiment 1, we compare the performance of these two approaches on a large number of exam scheduling problem instances. 
In experiment 2, we try to explain the behavior of the two algorithms against a problem characteristics. What may happen is 
SLS may perform well for some problem instances and underperform for others compared to the evolutionary approach - and this behavior may be explained by some characteristics like number of courses / number of students etc. The target of this experiment is to analyze and discuss the data to show how the characteristic predicts or explains the performance.

I used a characteristics called Exam Conflict Density (R. Qu, 1995) to explain the exam scheduling problem characteristics here.
